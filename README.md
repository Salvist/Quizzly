A new Flutter project for LangInnov Coding Assignment.


## Getting Started

This is a quiz app that will show 5 random questions.

At the moment, all of the questions are hard-coded inside the code and there are only 10 questions.

So out of the 10 questions, 5 questions will be chosen randomly and then given to the user to answer.

After answering all of the questions, the number of correct answer and the percentage will be given with different kind of messages based on the percentage.
