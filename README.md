A new Flutter project for LangInnov Coding Assignment.


## Getting Started

This is a quiz app that will show 5 random questions.

At the moment, all of the questions are hard-coded inside the code and there are only 10 questions.

So out of the 10 questions, 5 questions will be chosen randomly and then given to the user to answer.

After answering all of the questions, the number of correct answer and the percentage will be given with different kind of messages based on the percentage.

All of the given questions will shown again with the correct answer.


## How to Install

Android: There is a folder in this github main page called apk. I have put the release build of the app in that folder.

Download it, install to your android phone / AVD, and click install despite of the warning (may warn about untrusted developer, don't worry nothing malicious since the source code is also here in lib).

iOS: I don't have iOS so I never tested the app in iOS. Given an iOS device, I will definitely love to try the app on iOS. Nonetheless, I don't think iOS will let anyone to install any app that is outside of their AppStore(?).

## How to Run the code in your Android Studio:
Clone the repository, then in your android studio, navigate to the project folder.
In the terminal in Android Studio, run flutter pub get to get all of the needed packages.
Once it's done, everything should be good.
